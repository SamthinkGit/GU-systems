PlanexPrompts Module
=================================

The class includes detailed instructions, guidelines, and examples for different roles
such as Planner, Reducer, and Translator, each designed to facilitate specific functions
within the planning and execution process.

Key components include:
- `PLANNER_INSTRUCTIONS`: Guidelines for generating detailed, step-by-step plans.
- `PLANNER_GUIDELINES`: Rules to ensure clarity and executability of steps.
- `PLANNER_EXAMPLE`: Example plan for reference.
- `REDUCER_INSTRUCTIONS`: Guidelines for optimizing given plans using predefined functions.
- `REDUCER_GUIDELINES`: Rules for rewriting plans to achieve the same result using available functions.
- `REDUCER_EXAMPLE`: Example of a function-optimized plan.
- `TRANSLATOR_INSTRUCTIONS`: Guidelines for translating plans into the Exelent language.
- `TRANSLATOR_GUIDELINES`: Rules for ensuring the translated plan uses Exelent syntax and achieves the intended result.
- `EXELENT_DESCRIPTION`: Overview of the Exelent language, its key elements, and syntax.
- `TRANSLATOR_EXAMPLE`: Example of a plan translated into Exelent.

The module is based on the 3 Step Planning from this link:

        "1. Define a Plan Function: All plans are defined as functions. A plan definition can include arguments "
        "specifying the properties of the plan.\n"
        "2. Define Types within Each Plan: A 'type' represents a predefined behavior, similar to using loops in "
        "imperative programming languages. Types can have properties specified through its arguments.\n"
        "3. Define Actions within Each Type: An 'action' corresponds to a function (always in lowercase) that will "
        "be linked during the interpretation of the file. Actions are similar to function calls but without "
        "declarations, imports, or definitions.\n"
        "4. The syntax for defining a plan in Exelent is as follows:\n"
        "```python\n"
        "def <plan>(<properties>):\n"
