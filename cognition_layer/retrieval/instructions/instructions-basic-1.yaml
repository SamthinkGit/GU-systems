  - title: Checking if an app is already installed
    requires:
      experts: [code-interpreter]
      packages: [apps-management]
    content: |
      If the user asks about if an app is installed you can use the apps-management
      package to try to find the application. If you can't find it, then you can ask
      the user if they want you to install it or keep searching. Either way, you can
      redirect this task to the CodeAndFileManagementExpert.

  - title: File finding
    requires:
      experts: [code-interpreter]
      packages: [mouse-simple]
    content: |
      If you have to find a document, generally it is a good idea to ask the user
      about the information they know (content, name, suffix, etc.) and then
      call the CodeAndFileManagementExpert to handle it.

  - title: File handling, editing, creating, touching...
    requires:
      experts: [code-interpreter]
      packages: []
    content: |
      If the user asks about creating, building, or editing one or multiple files,
      it's generally a good idea to obtain information about the target directory,
      files, and content, and then call the CodeAndFileManagementExpert directly.

  - title: Opening App
    requires:
      experts: [code-interpreter]
      packages: [apps-management]
    content: |
      If the user asks for opening an app, generally check if it is already open.
      If so, activate it. If not, search among the installed apps and open it.
      If that fails, you can call the CodeAndFileManagementExpert and give it a last try.

  - title: Writing document
    requires:
      experts: []
      packages: [simple-read-ocr, keyboard]
    content: |
      If the user asks for writing a document, you should first check in which application
      you are. Then you should ask the user where they want to have the response written.
      Open the target app/document and, when you are sure you focused it (ensure to click on it),
      start writing. You can try first checking with OCR if you are writing correctly, and
      then continue if successful.

  - title: Shortcuts
    requires:
      experts: []
      packages: [press_keys]
    content: |
      If the user asks about a shortcut, usually you just have to return it as a response.
      If the user specifically asks for executing a shortcut, then you must use the press_keys
      package to use it.

  - title: Asking about the current screen
    requires:
      experts: []
      packages: [moondream_vision_actions]
    content: |
      If the user asks or makes a query about the current screen, it usually is enough to just
      use moondream_vision to obtain information about the screen and then return the appropriate response.

  - title: Show something to the user (Spotlight)
    requires:
      experts: []
      packages: [spotlight, simple-read-ocr, moondream_vision_actions]
    content: |
      If the user asks you to show, point, or indicate something, you must usually stay in the
      same application (unless the user specifies otherwise) and use vision + OCR to analyze
      the screen. Then, the spotlight package is a good tool for indicating what the user asks for
      (for example, a button or an element).

  - title: GUI helping (mails, apps, documents...)
    requires:
      experts: [small-vision-agent]
      packages: [keyboard]
    content: |
      If the user asks you to help with a GUI task, you can use the small-vision-agent
      to help you. You can ask him to find elements, buttons, or any other information
      that you need. Then when the user confirmed you are in the right place, you can
      use the keyboard package to interact with the GUI.

  - title: Web browsing
    requires:
      experts: [planner-expert, code-interpreter]
      packages: [simple-read-ocr, mouse-simple, apps-management]
    content: |
      If the user asks you to browse the web, you can use the apps-management package to open the browser.
      If the user is already opened you can use it. However in both cases you will want to use the keyboard
      or mouse to open a new tab and not think about the current tab. Then you must use the mouse to click on
      the search bar. One trick: The search bar usually contains a message that can be found with OCR.
      When you ensured you are in the search bar, write the query and then press enter. Then wait and check the
      page loaded (vision, ocr), then check with ocr the page and select a tab, and then repeat until you dont find
      a valid tab and use vision. If you reach the goal, then you can exit. Please ensure to check each page has been
      clicked, a lot of icons can missguide you.

  - title: Giving the hour
    requires:
      experts: [code-interpreter]
      packages: [simple-read-ocr]
